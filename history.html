                    Founded sometime before the 1290s,[3] Beauxbatons had many noteworthy students over the years. Most prominent were Nicolas Flamel, the alchemist famed for creating the Philosopher's Stone, and his wife Perenelle.[1] Apart from the Flamels, famous ex-students of Beauxbatons included Vincent Duc de Trefle-Picques, who escaped the Terror by casting a Concealment Charm on his own neck and pretending that his head had already been cut off; Luc Millefeuille, the infamous pastry-maker and Muggle-poisoner; and Fleur Delacour, who fought in the world-famous Battle of Hogwarts, married Bill Weasley, and was awarded medals of bravery from both the French and British Ministries of Magic.[1] Olympe Maxime, Headmistress in the mid 1990s, was (in spite of her protestations to the contrary) a half-giantess; clever, elegant, and undeniably awe-inspiring.[1]

                    <div class="historytext2"><p>Beauxbatons participated in the Triwizard Tournament that was held in 1792 and the tournament that was held in 1994. During the 1792 tournament one of the tasks involved catching a cockatrice. However, the beast went on a rampage and injured three of the judges; one of the injured was at the time the head of Beauxbatons. In the 1994 tournament, Fleur was selected school champion and finished in fourth place behind the other three contestants. During the 1994 tournament, Madame Maxime served as head of the academy.[2]
